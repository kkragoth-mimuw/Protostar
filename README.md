# Protostar

Wave shooter game made using Unity3d designed for Android (as part of JNP2 course @ MIMUW)

Core gameplay code is finished [Assets/Scripts],
Graphics are kept simple for better mobile perfomance (sadly using pixel light drops fps to ~15 fps)

Some ideas that I currently lack time to finish:
- add pickups
- design interesting wave progression
- different missiles/enemies type
- high score system

TODO:
- Fix spawn bug

I'm using sounds from freesound.org and free Assets from Unity Store (such as: CNJ Controls)
